  <comment>Guava is a suite of core and expanded libraries that include
    utility classes, google&apos;s collections, io classes, and much
    much more.

    Guava has only one code dependency - javax.annotation,
    per the JSR-305 spec. NO_M2ECLIPSE_SUPPORT: Project files created with the maven-eclipse-plugin are not supported in M2Eclipse.</comment>
